# Web Scraping with Python
Getting data from the original website of [greek super league](https://www.slgr.gr/el/) about each game from seasons 2006-2007 to 2021-2022. My purpose is to do an exploratory data analysis on these data at a later point.

### Prerequisites
* Requests
* BeautifulSoup
* pandas 

### Walk-through of the project

Considering the [schedule page](https://www.slgr.gr/el/schedule/), there are two things to consider at first:
* Seasons

* Super league games (and not play off's / play out's)
